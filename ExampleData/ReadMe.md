# Example Data for testing IntelliPy

Each directory contains the nosepoke.txt, visit.txt and animal.txt files, that are extracted from the TSE Analyzer and a group assignment file, that can be manualy created,
according to the group relation of each individual mouse.

Either the Animal.txt or the group assignment file are necessary - not both. The group assignment files were created here to show, how the corresponding files would look like, if the Animal.txt files were not sufficient.

The group assignment files can further be modified to assign animals to other groups, e.g. based on gender, genotype or any other condition.
