# Example Data for testing IntelliPy
 The example data is copied and adapted from the [PyMICE project](https://github.com/Neuroinflab/PyMICE/) and distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0

Each directory contains the _Nosepoke.txt_, _Visit.txt_ and _Animal.txt_ files, that are extracted from the TSE Analyzer and a group assignment file, that can be manually created,
according to the group relation of each individual mouse.

Either the _Animal.txt_ or the group assignment file are necessary - not both. The group assignment files were created here to show, how the corresponding files would look like, if the _Animal.txt_ files were not sufficient.

The group assignment files can further be modified to assign animals to other groups, e.g. based on gender, genotype or any other condition or to add the alternative label, if any was used.

For the prupose of showing the behavior of IntelliPy if alternative labels were used, two example dataset were modified so that they contain an alternative label (_C57AB_2012-08-28_2_Sucrose_, _C57AB_2012-08-31_2_Sucrose_).
